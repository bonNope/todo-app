# todo-app
## About The Project

This is a rest api written in golang. The project was created to show my skills in writing back-end.

This project implements the simplified logic of the todo application from Microsoft. The application implements:

* Users registration and authentication with JWT tokens
* CRUD operations on to-do lists
* CRUD operations on tasks (items)
